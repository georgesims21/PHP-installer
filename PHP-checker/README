NAME
PHP-checker for centos8

SYNOPSIS
sudo ./PHP-checker.sh [PHP VERSION] [LOOP] [INCLUDE EXTENSION TESTS]

DESCRIPTION
Given a PHP VERSION previously installed by PHP-installer, this script will verify that this PHP version is
installed and working, that common configuration files have not changed since the install and extensions
are loaded and functional. If the loop flag is given, this script will output once per minute until user sends exit
signal. If the extension tests flag is given, the script will also check the extension tests but be aware that this
leads to a loop lasting longer than 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
The output format of this script is in the form of 'variable: error', with 1 representing an error and 0 no error. Due to
time constraints icinga2 compatible format was not made, but an educated guess as to how a monitoring program may read
data from a source was used instead.
Verbose output can be found in the /tmp/php-checker.log file, if any errors occur during this script, you will find the output in this log.

FLAGS
LOOP : loop once per minute
EXTENSION TESTS : include extension tests (1:17 on an i770u processor with all tests)

EXAMPLES
sudo ./PHP-checker.sh 8.0 : run checker on an already installed PHP 8.0
sudo ./PHP-checker.sh 8.0 y : run checker with a loop, but no extension tests
sudo ./PHP-checker.sh 8.0 y y: run checker with a loop, with extension tests

SUPPORTED PHP VERSIONS
8.0, 7.3 and 7.4 can be used with this script, future work can see more added, but these are the main stable versions of PHP
at the time of writing.

PITFALLS
The extension tests cannot be run without the loop flag. More time could have seen this implemented.
