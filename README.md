# PHP-installer and checker

## Part 1
A shell script to install PHP from source and some example packages. 
This can be found within the PHP-installer directory along with its README on how to use. Also in here is a install-dependencies.sh script, which should be run before the main script to install necessary dependencies.

## Part 2
A shell script to check the script from part 1.
This can be found within the PHP-checker directory, again along with a README.
